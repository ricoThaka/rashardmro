>The first version of the pair of images above was processed onboard the rover into a color image. Once scientists back on Earth receive such images, they perform additional processing to improve contrast and sharpness, and to correct for distortions caused by the camera's fisheye lens (the curved edges of the final image are the result of correcting for those distortions).

This pair of images shows the [Martian](https://youtu.be/v_buptZpbw0?si=KyQlcHMa4Bbfx8-c) surface captured by NASA's Curiosity rover using its Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) camera on Nov. 7, 2024, the 4,357th Martian day, or sol, of the mission. The raw image on the left has not been processed; on the right is the same image after being processed on Earth to reveal additional details in the camera's images, which were taken after sunset, when the lighting is more uniform than the harsh shadows that occur earlier in the [day](https://youtu.be/KOdMvTnckvs?si=OtJD46lH40m_cgxn).

MARDI was designed to capture images from below the rover as Curiosity descended to the surface on Aug. 5, 2012. (Those images were later assembled together to create the first video of a descent to the Martian surface.) After landing, the mission repurposed MARDI as a surface camera. They use it to take a snapshot at the end of every drive to document the changing terrain and textures the mission has come across during its exploration of Gale Crater and the 3-mile-tall (5-kilometer-tall) mountain within it, Mount Sharp.

MARDI views the surface just behind the rover's left front wheel, which is visible in the images. While it is not in sharp focus on the surface (the camera was designed to capture the long-range imaging during descent) but is able to resolve features as small as a few millimeters (0.1 inch). Likewise, because MARDI wasn't intended to be a surface camera, it lacks a dust cover. As a result, its dusty lens mutes colors and details.



Because of that additional processing, MARDI has provided a useful way to study rock layering, textures, mineral veins, wheel tracks, and sand ripples – all of which are apparent in the second, processed, image here. Occasionally scientists will take a series of images while Curiosity drives, creating an image strip that documents changes across the surface. When the rover remains stationary (such as when it's collecting and processing a rock sample) a series of images can reveal the movement of windblown sand.

Figure A shows the image before processing on Earth.

Figure B shows the image after processing on Earth.

Curiosity was built by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is managed by Caltech in Pasadena, California. JPL leads the mission on behalf of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego built and operates MARDI.

The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) [1, 2] has a suite of instruments
making observations at Mars, and it provides data-relay services for Mars
landers and rovers. MRO was launched on August 12, 2005. The orbiter
successfully went into orbit around Mars on March 10, 2006 and began
reducing its orbit altitude and circularizing the orbit in preparation for the
science mission. The orbit changing was accomplished through a process called aerobraking, in preparation for the “science mission” starting in November
2006, followed by the “relay mission” starting in November 2008. MRO
participated in the Mars Science Laboratory touchdown and surface mission
that began in August 2012 (Chapter 7).

The establishment of the USSF resulted from widespread recognition that space is a national security imperative. When combined with the growing threat posed by strategic competitors in space, it became clear that there was a need for a military service focused solely on pursuing superiority in the space domain.

[The Moon - Clementine](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/clm_usgs_17.html) Clementine was a joint project between the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization and NASA. The objective of the mission was to test sensors and spacecraft components under extended exposure to the space environment and to make scientific observations of the Moon and the near-Earth asteroid 1620 Geographos. The observations included imaging at various wavelengths including ultraviolet and infrared, laser ranging altimetry, and charged particle measurements. These observations were originally for the purposes of assessing the surface mineralogy of the Moon and Geographos, obtaining lunar altimetry from 60N to 60S latitude, and determining the size, shape, rotational characteristics, surface properties, and cratering statistics of Geographos.
Clementine was launched on 25 January 1994 at 16:34 UTC (12:34 PM EDT) from Vandenberg AFB aboard a Titan IIG rocket. After two Earth flybys, lunar insertion was achieved on February 21. Lunar mapping took place over approximately two months, in two parts. The first part consisted of a 5 hour elliptical polar orbit with a perilune of about 400 km at 28 degrees S latitude. After one month of mapping the orbit was rotated to a perilune of 29 degrees N latitude, where it remained for one more month. This allowed global imaging as well as altimetry coverage from 60 degrees S to 60 degrees N.

i had a good thing going with [nth-child floats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child). [@sawmac thanks!] Every other image is either left or right justified. Each timne i upload a photo the layout changes bc images get shifted to the opposite side of the screen. I know im communicating well at times and the variety will help at least in my theroy not be as challenging to revisit for those that need to look at research/interest/ activity record. This is my first try at nested css. i just [started updating my CV](ricothaka.github.io/cv) and the Nested array concept i learned in `ruby` seems to be common thing in programming if u consider any array of items this one is unexpected bc it will always grow the array is whats displayed on screen

## Deimos Eclipse
Deimos is the smaller of Mars' two moons. It's 9 by 7 by 6.8 miles in size (15 by 12 by 11 kilometers). Deimos orbits Mars every 30 hours.Deimos was discovered on Aug. 11, 1877 by Asaph Hall. Hall named Mars' moons for the mythological sons of Ares, the Greek counterpart of the Roman god, Mars. Deimos, whose name means dread, is the brother of Phobos.

# About Kashdoll and Me Updated
Jamie, Robin I am running across her more often and i have reason to belive she is manessah my Family Services rep and i got hen pecked and run over so they could change a lot of ppl life real quick after the [insurrection in washington](https://www.nationalguard.mil/News/Article/2466077/dod-details-national-guard-response-to-capitol-attack/). That sounds like a crazy theory to me, but i think she got picked up by playboy in highschool, [she in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuNx-_dqM90). She always quick visits and this tape [Trapped in The Dollhouse](https://audiomack.com/kashbratz/album/trapped-in-the-dollhouse-1) i got an update after she was twerking inviting me to be more friendly in the studio. Mind you all this political turmoil is amuck! And once the Riot happened its like atlanta fell apart, but in this message i get that she is brotheled in some way! In BratMail she let me know she was looking at me `On my new new shit, like my name is Rashaad` that was my update.

[Intro]
So everyones been wondering why
Kash Doll's been rapping on everyone else beats
And why she's been riding other people waves
And, um, why she's killing all these remixes?
It's because I can't put my own original music out, okay?
It's because I signed myself in a hoe ass contract
I did that and now I'm trapped inside of a fucking dollhouse
And I wanna get out of this shit
No way to escape the dollhouse
But you know what?
Timing is everything and I think God has perfect timing
So right now, I'm just gonna get on every fucking beat there is
{% endhighlight %}

[January 6 U.S. Capitol attack riot, Washington, D.C., U.S. [2021]](https://www.britannica.com/event/January-6-U-S-Capitol-attack) January 6 U.S. Capitol attack, storming of the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, by a mob of supporters of Republican Pres. Donald J. Trump. The attack disrupted a joint session of Congress convened to certify the results of the presidential election of 2020, which Trump had lost to his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden. Because its object was to prevent a legitimate president-elect from assuming office, the attack was widely regarded as an insurrection or attempted coup d’état. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other law-enforcement agencies also considered it an act of domestic terrorism. For having given a speech before the attack in which he encouraged a large crowd of his supporters near the White House to march to the Capitol and violently resist Congress’s certification of Biden’s victory—which many in the crowd then did—Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led House of Representatives for “incitement of insurrection” (he was subsequently acquitted by the Senate).

{% highlight ruby %} 
[Verse]
Look, I be exploring the foreigns with more power than stars
On my new new shit, like my name is Rashaad
And my punchlines seasoned plenty minds like it's time
So, if he ever tell you he ain't feelin' me, he lying'
Shout out to me, all on BET
I'm a very rich chick, on my Nene Leakes
I'm a boss, every move gotta come through me
Murder broads in my minks
May they rest in peace
And I'm still the top chick
Any bitch think I drop dick get higher than Mariah
And she like a five octave
Stop it, please stop it
Blowing money
All in Neiman's in there Diddy bopping
And you know I came to murder it
My city watchin'
I'm so humble, I'ma front like I don't do this often
It's Kash Doll, bow down, and kiss the ring
Soon as this paperwork done
I'm touching everything
A murder scene

[Outro]
Haha
Yeah, that way
The doll way

# 26 November 2018
InSight successfully landed on Mars on 26 November 2018. Due to excessive dust on its solar panels preventing it from recharging, NASA put InSight in low-power mode for detecting seismic events in July 2022 and continued monitoring the lander through the operational period ending in December 2022.

  Mission Overview
  ================

    The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft was launched from Cape
    Canaveral Air Force Station on 12 August 2005 aboard a Lockheed-Martin
    Atlas V-401 launch vehicle. After a five-month cruise and a two-month
    approach to Mars, MRO entered Mars' orbit on 10 March 2006 and began
    aerobraking.  The primary science phase began on 8 November, 2006. The
    primary science phase is planned to last one Mars year (approximately two
    Earth years), after which an extended mission may be scheduled. 
    
    Note: This description has been written early in the Primary Science
    Phase of the MRO mission. It will be revised at least once by the
    end of the mission. 
    
  Mission Phases
  ==============
  
    The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Mission is divided in time into six
    phases: Launch, Cruise, Approach and Orbit Insertion, Aerobraking, 
    Primary Science, and Relay.

    LAUNCH
    ------
      Launch extended from the start of the countdown to the initial 
      acquisition, by the DSN, of the orbiter in a safe and stable 
      configuration.
      
      The baseline launch vehicle for the MRO mission was the Lockheed-Martin
      Atlas V 401.  This launch vehicle was selected by NASA-KSC (Kennedy
      Space Flight Center) via a competitive procurement under the NASA 
      Launch Services (NLS) contract.  The Atlas V 401 was a two-stage 
      launch vehicle consisting of the Atlas Common Core Booster and a 
      single engine Centaur upper stage.  The Centaur upper stage could 
      perform multiple restarts of its main engine.  For precise pointing and 
      control during coast and powered flight, the Centaur used a flight 
      control system that was 3-axis stabilized. The Atlas large payload 
      fairing was used to protect MRO during the Atlas boost phase.  This 
      fairing had a diameter of 4.2m and a length of 12.2m.
      
      The launch and injection of MRO occured during the Mars opportunity
      of August 2005. The Atlas booster, in combination with the Centaur 
      upper stage, delivered the MRO spacecraft into a targeted parking 
      orbit. After a short coast, a restart of the Centaur upper stage 
      injected MRO onto an interplanetary transfer trajectory.

      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2005-08-12

    CRUISE
    ------
      Duration: About five months. The cruise phase extended from DSN
      initial acquisition, in a safe and stable configuration, until two
      months prior to the Mars Orbit Insertion (MOI) maneuver. Primary
      activities during cruise included spacecraft and payload checkout and
      calibration.  These activities, along with daily monitoring of orbiter
      subsystems, were performed in order to fully characterize the
      performance of the spacecraft and its payload prior to arrival at
      Mars.  In addition, standard navigation activities were performed
      during this flight phase, the first being the largest TCM performed
      fifteen days after launch.

      Mission Phase Start Time : 2005-08-12
      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2006-01-10

    APPROACH AND ORBIT INSERTION
    ----------------------------
      This phase extended from two months prior to Mars Orbit Insertion
      (MOI), through MOI, and until the orbiter was checked out and ready to
      begin aerobraking. The orbiter was inserted into a nearly polar orbit
      with a period of 35 hours.
      
      During the last sixty days of the interplanetary transit, spacecraft
      and ground activities were focused on the events necessary for a
      successful arrival and safe capture at Mars. Navigation techniques
      included the use of delta-DOR measurements in the orbit determination.
      This technique yielded a precise determination of the inbound
      trajectory with a series of final TCMs used to control the flight path
      of the spacecraft up to the MOI maneuver.
      
      Also during the approach phase, MRO performed the Optical Navigation
      experiment.  This involved pointing the optical navigation camera
      (ONC) at the moons of Mars - Phobos and Deimos, and tracking their
      motion. By comparing the observed position of the moons to their
      predicted positions, relative to the background stars, the ground was
      able to accurately determine the position of the orbiter.
      
      Upon arrival at Mars on March 10, 2006, the spacecraft performed its
      MOI maneuver using its six main engines.  MOI inserted the spacecraft
      into an initial, highly elliptical capture orbit.  The delta-V
      required to accomplish this critical maneuver was 1015 m/s and took
      about 26 minutes to complete. For most of the burn, the orbiter was
      visible from the DSN stations.  The signal was occulted as the orbiter
      went behind Mars, and appeared again a short time later. The reference
      MRO capture orbit had a period of 35 hours and a periapsis altitude of
      300km.  The orientation of the ascending node was 8:30 PM LMST.  The
      capture orbit was been selected such that aerobraking would be
      completed prior to the start of solar conjunction (September 23,
      2006).

      Mission Phase Start Time : 2006-01-10
      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2006-03-10


    AEROBRAKING
    -----------
      The Aerobraking Phase of the mission consisted of three sub-phases, 
      Aerobraking Operations, Transition to PSO Operations, and Solar 
      Conjunction. 
      
      Aerobraking Operations Sub-Phase 
      --------------------------------
      
      One week after MOI, aerobraking operations commenced.  During this
      time period, the orbiter used aerobraking techniques to supplement its
      onboard propulsive capability and to reduce its orbit period to that
      necessary for the primary science orbit (PSO).  Aerobraking Operations
      consisted of a walk-in phase, a main phase, and a walkout phase, and  
      was followed by a transition to the PSO.  During the walk-in phase, the
      spacecraft established initial contact with the atmosphere as the 
      periapsis altitude of the orbit was slowly lowered.  The walk-in phase 
      continued until the dynamic pressures and heating rate values required 
      for main phase, or steady state aerobraking, were established.  During 
      the main phase of aerobraking operations, large scale orbit period 
      reduction occurred as the orbiter was guided to dynamic pressure 
      limits. Main phase aerobraking continued until the orbit lifetime of 
      the orbiter reached 2 days.  (Orbit lifetime is defined as the time it 
      takes the apoapsis altitude of the orbit to decay to an altitude of 
      300km.)  When the orbit lifetime of the orbiter reached 2 days, the 
      walkout phase of aerobraking operations began.  During the walkout 
      phase, the periapsis altitude of the orbit was slowly increased as the 
      2 day orbit lifetime of the orbiter was maintained.  Once the orbit of 
      the orbiter reached an apoapsis altitude of 450km, the orbiter 
      terminated aerobraking by propulsively raising the periapsis of its 
      orbit out of the atmosphere.
      
      Because the PSO had nodal orientation requirements, the aerobraking
      phase of the MRO mission had to proceed in a timely manner and be
      completed near the time the desired nodal geometry was achieved. After
      approximately 4.5 months of aerobraking, the dynamic pressure control
      limits were reset such that the orbiter will fly to the desired 3:00
      pm LMST nodal target. 
      
      Transition to PSO Operations Sub-Phase
      --------------------------------------
      
      Once the orbit apoapsis altitude was reduced to 450 km, the orbiter
      terminated aerobraking by raising periapsis to a safe altitude and
      begin a transition to the Primary Science Phase.  The periapsis of 
      the transition orbit rotated around Mars from over the equatorial 
      latitudes to the North Pole.  When periapsis reached the North Pole, 
      apoapsis was reduced propulsively to 255 km and orbit rotation stopped 
      - the orbit was frozen with periapsis over the South Pole and apoapsis 
      over the North Pole.  The SHARAD antenna and the CRISM cover were 
      deployed, the instruments were checked out and remaining calibrations 
      were performed.  The payloads collected data in their normal operating 
      modes to ensure that the end-to-end data collection and processing 
      systems worked as planned.  
      
      Solar Conjuction Sub-Phase
      --------------------------
      
      Orbiter activities in preparation for science were then temporarily 
      suspended during a four week period surrounding solar conjunction.

    PRIMARY SCIENCE
    ---------------
      The 255 x 320 km Primary Science Orbit (PSO) is a near-polar orbit
      with periapsis frozen over the South Pole.  It is sun-synchronous with
      an ascending node orientation that provides a Local Mean Solar Time
      (LMST) of 3:00 p.m. at the equator.  Because of the eccentricity of
      the Mars orbit around the Sun, true solar time varies by nearly 45
      minutes over the course of one Mars year.
      
      The Primary Science Phase of the mission began after solar conjunction
      and after turn-on and checkout of the science instruments in the
      Primary Science Orbit.  The phase started on 8 November 2006, will
      extend for one Mars year, and will conclude prior the next solar
      conjunction near the end of 2008.
      
      The science investigations are functionally divided into daily global
      mapping and profiling, regional survey, and globally distributed
      targeting investigations.  The global mapping instruments are the MCS
      and the MARCI.  The targeted investigations are HiRISE, CRISM, and
      CTX. The survey investigations are CRISM and CTX (in survey modes),
      and SHARAD.  The global mapping instruments require nadir pointing,
      low data rate, and continuous or near-continuous operations.  The
      global mapping investigations are expected to use less than 5% of the
      expected downlink data volume.  The targeted and survey instruments
      are high data rate instruments and will require precise targeting in
      along-track timing and/or cross-track pointing for short periods of
      time over selected portions of the surface.  It is expected that more
      than 95% of the available downlink data volume will be used for
      targeted and survey investigations. All instruments can take data
      simultaneously.
      
      Toward the end of the primary science phase, other Mars missions
      launched in the 2007 opportunity will begin to arrive. Phoenix, the
      first of the Mars Program's Scout missions has been selected to launch
      in the 2007 Mars opportunity. Phoenix, a lander mission that will
      collect and analyze subsurface ice and soil material, will arrive in
      late May 2008. Phoenix will need MRO to characterize its prime landing
      site choices early in the Primary Science Phase. MRO will provide
      relay support for Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) activities and for
      telecommunications late in the PSP after Phoenix arrives at Mars.
      Phoenix and MRO will also coordinate some observations to maximize
      science return to the Mars Exploration Program. Another mission, the
      Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) is currently proposed for launch in
      2009, with arrival in 2010, during the MRO Relay Phase.
      
      MSL will need MRO to provide and characterize candidate landing sites
      using observations taken during the MRO PSP. (Final certification of
      the prime MSL landing sites may require limited observations by the
      science payload in 2009 during the Relay phase. However, this has not
      been committed to by MRO) MRO will also provide EDL support and relay
      telecommunications for MSL. During the primary science phase, periodic
      instrument calibrations will be performed to verify the measurement
      characteristics, stability and health of the instruments. At the
      conclusion of the Primary Science Phase, these calibrations will be
      repeated, so that the final instrument characteristics are known.
      
      NASA may approve, as resources and on-orbit capability permit,
      continuation of science observations beyond the Primary Science Phase
      until end of the Relay Phase (also End of Mission).  The orbiter will
      remain in the Primary Science Orbit during the Relay Phase.

      Mission Phase Start Time : 2006-11-08
      Mission Phase Stop Time  : 2008-11-09


    RELAY
    -----
      MRO will provide critical relay support to missions launched as part
      of the Mars Exploration Program after MRO.  For spacecraft launched in
      the 2007 opportunity, this relay support will occur before the end of
      the MRO Primary Science Phase.   Following completion of the Primary
      Science Phase, MRO will continue to provide critical relay support for
      Mars missions until its end of mission.
      
      While all of the missions that MRO will support have not yet been
      selected, Phoenix, the first of the Mars Program's Scout missions has
      been selected to launch in the 2007 Mars opportunity.  Phoenix, a
      lander mission that will collect and analyze soil samples, will arrive
      in late May 2008.  It will need science imaging support for site
      characterization and selection and relay support for its Entry,
      Descent and Landing activities and for its science data return. 
      Another mission, the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) is proposed for the
      2009 Mars opportunity.  MSL will also need science imaging support for
      site characterization and selection and relay support for EDL and
      science data return.  The MRO Mission Plan describes the generic
      support activities for any mission as well as current early planning
      in support of Phoenix and MSL.  Activities regarding site
      characterization and selection will be described as part of the
      Primary Science Phase, and activities regarding relay support will be
      described as part of the Relay Phase.
      
      The orbiter has been designed to carry enough propellant to remain
      operational for 5 years beyond the end-of-mission (EOM) on December
      31, 2010 to support future MEP missions.  As this is beyond the EOM,
      no activities have been planned for this time period.  To ensure that
      the orbiter remains in a viable orbit during this time, its orbit
      altitude will be increased at EOM to about 20 km inside the orbit of
      the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft.
      
      The MRO approach to planetary protection differs from any previous
      Mars orbiter.  The NASA requirements for planetary protection,
      NPG8020.12B, allow a class III mission, like MRO, to use either the
      'probability of impact/orbit lifetime' or a 'total bio burden'
      approach.  Implementing the Level 1 MRO requirements with the
      instruments selected via the NASA AO requires low orbits whose
      lifetimes are incompatible with a 'probability of impact/orbit
      lifetime' approach to Planetary Protection.  Therefore, MRO is
      implementing the requirements of NPG8020.12B using the 'total
      bio-burden' approach.  This approach has been documented in the MRO
      Planetary Protection Plan (D-23711). The details of cleaning
      requirements are documented in the MRO Planetary Protection
      Implementation Plan, MRO 212-11, JPL D-22688. The MRO launch targets
      will be biased away from a direct intercept course with Mars to ensure
      a less than 1 in 10,000 chance of the launch vehicle upper stage
      entering Mars atmosphere.
      
      The End-of-Mission (EOM) is planned for December 31, 2010 just prior
      to the third solar conjunction of the mission.  The orbiter will
      perform a propulsive maneuver to place itself in a higher orbit to
      increase the orbit lifetime and enable extended mission operations.

    MISSION_OBJECTIVES_SUMMARY  = "

  The driving theme of the Mars Exploration Program is to understand the
  role of water on Mars and its implications for possible past or
  current biological activity.  The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)
  Project will pursue this 'Follow-the-Water' strategy by conducting
  remote sensing observations that return sets of globally distributed
  data that will:  1) advance our understanding of the current Mars
  climate, the processes that have formed and modified the surface of
  the planet, and the extent to which water has played a role in surface
  processes; 2) identify sites of possible aqueous activity indicating
  environments that may have been or are conducive to biological
  activity; and 3) thus identify and characterize sites for future
  landed missions. 
  
  The MRO payload is designed to conduct remote sensing science
  observations, identify and characterize sites for future landers, and
  provide critical telecom/navigation relay capability for follow-on
  missions.  The mission will provide global, regional survey, and
  targeted observations from a low 255 km by 320 km Mars orbit with a
  3:00 P.M. local mean solar time (ascending node).  During the one
  Martian year (687 Earth days) primary science phase, the orbiter will
  acquire visual and near-infrared high-resolution images of the
  planet's surface, monitor atmospheric weather and climate, and search
  the upper crust for evidence of water.  After this science phase is
  completed, the orbiter will provide telecommunications support for
  spacecraft launched to Mars in the 2007 and 2009 opportunities.  The
  primary mission will end on December 31, 2010, approximately 5.5 years
  after launch.


  Science Questions Addressed
  ---------------------------

    The MRO mission has the primary objective of placing a science orbiter
    into Mars orbit to perform remote sensing investigations that will
    characterize the surface, subsurface and atmosphere of the planet and
    will identify potential landing sites for future missions.  The MRO
    payload will conduct observations in many parts of the electromagnetic
    spectrum, including ultraviolet and visible imaging, visible to
    near-infrared imaging spectrometry, thermal infrared atmospheric
    profiling, and radar subsurface sounding, at spatial resolutions
    substantially better than any preceding Mars orbiter.  In pursuit of
    its science objectives, the MRO mission will:

    - Characterize Mars' seasonal cycles and diurnal variations of water,
      dust, and carbon dioxide.
    - Characterize Mars' global atmospheric structure, transport, and 
      surface changes.
    - Search sites for evidence of aqueous and/or hydrothermal activity.
    - Observe and characterize the detailed stratigraphy, geologic 
      structure, and composition of Mars surface features.
    - Probe the near-surface Martian crust to detect subsurface structure, 
      including layering and potential reservoirs of water and/or water ice.
    - Characterize the Martian gravity field in greater detail relative to 
      previous Mars missions to improve knowledge of the Martian crust and 
      lithosphere and potentially of atmospheric mass variation.
    - Identify and characterize numerous globally distributed landing sites 
      with a high potential for scientific discovery by future missions.

    In addition, MRO will provide critical telecommunications relay
    capability for follow-on missions and will conduct, on a
    non-interference basis with the primary mission science, telecom and
    navigation demonstrations in support of future Mars Exploration
    Program (MEP) activities.  Specifically, the MRO mission will:
    
    - Provide navigation and data relay support services to future MEP
      missions.
    - Demonstrate Optical Navigation techniques for high precision delivery 
      of future landed missions.
    - Perform an operational demonstration of high data rate Ka-band 
      telecommunications and navigation services.

    Designed to operate after launch for at least 5.4 years, the MRO
    orbiter will use a new spacecraft bus design provided by Lockheed
    Martin Space Systems Company, Space Exploration Systems Division in
    Denver, Colorado.  The orbiter payload will consist of six science
    instruments and three new engineering payload elements listed as
    follows:

    Science Instruments
    - HiRISE, High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment 
    - CRISM, Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars
    - MCS, Mars Climate Sounder
    - MARCI, Mars Color Imager
    - CTX, Context Camera
    - SHARAD, Shallow (Subsurface) Radar
    
    Engineering Payloads
    - Electra UHF communications and navigation package
    - Optical Navigation (Camera) Experiment
    - Ka Band Telecommunication Experiment
    
    To fulfill the mission science goals, seven scientific investigations
    teams were selected by NASA.  Four teams (MARCI, MCS, HiRISE, and
    CRISM) are led by Principal Investigators (PI), each responsible for
    the provision and operation of a scientific instrument and the
    analysis of its data.  The MARCI PI and Science Team also act to
    provide and operate, as Team Leader (TL) and Team Members, the CTX
    facility instrument that will provide context imaging for HiRISE and
    CRISM, as well as acquire and analyze independent data in support of
    the MRO scientific objectives.  The Italian Space Agency (ASI) will
    provide a second facility instrument, SHARAD, for flight on MRO.  ASI
    and NASA have both selected members of the SHARAD investigation team. 
    In addition to the instrument investigations, Gravity Science and
    Atmospheric Structure Facility Investigation Teams will use data from
    the spacecraft telecommunications and accelerometers, respectively, to
    conduct scientific investigations. 
    
    The MRO shall accomplish its science objectives by conducting an
    integrated program of three distinct observational modes:
    
    - Daily global mapping and profiling observations
    - Regional survey observations, and 
    - Globally distributed, targeted observations
    
    These observation modes will be intermixed and often overlapping. 
    Some instruments have more than one observational mode.  In addition,
    many targeted observations will involve nearly simultaneous,
    coordinated observations by more than one instrument.  This program of
    scientific observation will be carried out for one Mars year or more
    in order to characterize the full seasonal variation of the Martian
    climate and to target hundreds of globally distributed sites with high
    potential for further scientific discovery. 

 Mission Success Criteria
 ------------------------

    The following mission success criteria have been established for the
    MRO Project. The mission success criteria are described and controlled
    in the MRO Project Implementation Plan.

    For Full Mission Success, the following criteria must be met:
